firmware for pico with usb audio, i2s, and dsp

this is modified for lower latency, and has limited dsp functions (biquads and scuffed full wave integrator, not used)

created for a project to power Valve Index speakers with a Pico/RP2040 and I2S amplifers (MAX98357/MAX98360)

based off pico-playground usb_sound_card
